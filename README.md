üïπÔ∏è Games in the Collection
1. Snake Game
Description: A modern take on the classic Snake game. Control the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with yourself or the walls.
Features:
Smooth grid-based movement.
Dynamic food spawning and score tracking.
Game-over and restart functionality.
Adjustable speed for gameplay difficulty.

2. Maze Game
Description: Navigate a procedurally generated maze as a player character animated with a GIF. Reach the exit to generate a new maze and start again.

Features:
Procedural maze generation using Depth-First Search (DFS).
Smooth player movement with directional animation.
Animated player character using a sprite sheet (GIF).
Maze regeneration upon reaching the exit.

# Gopher Platform Runner

A platform-based runner game featuring the Go gopher mascot traversing randomly generated levels.

## Features

- 10 progressively difficult levels with randomized platform generation
- Platform physics with jumping, double-jumping, wall-jumping, and dashing abilities
- Different platform types (normal, moving, breaking, bouncy)
- Collectibles to gather for points
- Obstacles to avoid
- Lives system and score tracking

## Controls

- **Left/Right Arrow Keys or A/D**: Move left/right
- **Space, W, or Up Arrow**: Jump (press again in mid-air for double jump)
- **Shift or E**: Dash
- **F1**: Toggle debug mode
- **Esc**: Pause game

## How to Run

Navigate to the mazeGame directory and run:

```bash
go run *.go
```

Or build an executable:

```bash
cd mazeGame
go build
./mazeGame
```

## Progression

- **Level 1-2**: Basic platforming
- **Level 3**: Unlocks double jump
- **Level 4-5**: Introduces moving and breaking platforms
- **Level 5**: Unlocks wall jump
- **Level 6-7**: Increases obstacles and platform difficulty
- **Level 7**: Unlocks dash ability
- **Level 8-10**: Maximum challenge with all mechanics

## Development

This game was created as an overhaul of a simple maze game, transformed into a full-featured platformer with physics, level progression, and advanced game mechanics.

Future improvements may include:
- Additional animations
- Sound effects and music
- More varied obstacle types
- Boss encounters
- Level editor

üí° What I Learned
Programming Concepts
Game Loops:

Managed game states (Update, Draw, and Layout methods in Ebiten).
Controlled animations and movements using frame counters.

Data Structures:
Position Structs: Represented grid-based entities (e.g., snake segments, maze cells).
2D Arrays: Used for procedural maze generation and collision detection.

Randomization:
Implemented random food spawning and maze generation using custom random number generators seeded with the current time.

Collision Detection:
Developed collision checks for boundaries, self-intersections (Snake), and maze walls (Maze Game).

Procedural Generation:
Created dynamic mazes using algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking.

Animation Handling:
Loaded and cycled through GIF frames for a smooth player character animation.
Controlled animation frame rates independently of game loop timing.
Programming Techniques

Event Handling:
Captured keyboard inputs for game controls.
Implemented directional movement logic and constraints.

Code Modularity:
Separated game logic into reusable structs and functions.
Created distinct functions for maze generation, collision checks, and drawing.

Error Handling:
Used proper error checks for file I/O when loading assets (e.g., GIF files).

Scaling and Transformation:
Applied Ebiten's GeoM transformations for sprite scaling and flipping (e.g., horizontal flipping for player direction).

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Ebiten: A simple and efficient library for creating 2D games in Go.
GIF Handling: Leveraged image/gif to load and manipulate animated sprites.
